1:
exceptions are expensive, as opposed to catching them and retrying

fixing underlying problem vs retry strategy?
false dilemma, you can do both
https://how.complexsystems.fail/

when retrying, we assume the failure rate is independent
it might not be
failure is not as quick as success
retry strategy - if problem is load-dependent might make problem worse

2:
when to use give up-strategy?
when the service isnt critical, but just nice to have
fail fast and return default values instead


3:
Service Level Indicator
add some metric p(99.duration10m) 
< 100 ms turns it into SLO ( service level objective )

Service level agreements might be a problematic internal metric due to punishments
Service level objectives is a goal to shoot for instead
